Breakout
========

Breakout is a quick paced and fun game where users attempt to break as many blocks as possible using a paddle.
This implementation of Breakout provides a number of pre-made levels in addition to a level editor where users can
modify the levels.

There are a number of features included in this game including:

 1. Collision detection in the game engine.
 2. Color coded blocks which indicate the amount of points each are worth.
 3. Gain life for every 1000 points earned.

Extra credit features include:
 1. Ability to save and load games.
 2. Options menu that allows user to adjust resolution of game and number of lives available.
 3. Graphical ball that we digitally created.


Running
=======

To run the game either click on the compiled jar file or run it on the command line.


Instructions
============

Using this game is very intuitive, however, this section will provide an explanation for specific sections worth
mentioning.

 1. Follow all instructions prompted on the screen throughout the game.
 2. Games may only be saved only while they are in progress.
 3. Use the left and right arrows to control the paddle.
 4. Refer to the help button on the lower left side of the screen in the level editor to take full advantage of the
    editor.

Note: This game is implemented as an application.

Division of Labor
=================

Work was divided as close to 50/50 as possible. We used git as a version control system that allowed for simultaneous
work.
